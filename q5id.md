# FAQ about Q5id

* **Store Personal and biometric data**
    Data, such as name, address, email, and phone number are **`encrypted and saved.`** Unless required, biometrics are not stored. Biometrics are converted into a character string using a hashing algorithm that cannot be reverse-engineered.

    Images may be stored when required by law or regulations specific to a given business. Any images we do store are **`secured in a data vault`**.

---

* **If an individual wants to use their Q5id Proven Identity with more than one company, do they have to prove their identity multiple times?**
    **`No`**. Proving your identity only needs to be completed **`one time`**.

    Once proven, your identity can be used to authenticate transactions with an **`unlimited number of companies`** based on their identity requirement.

    Any data in our **`databases is encrypted`**, ensuring that it can’t be stolen or misused. Even if it was, the encryption is such that no usable data can be recovered.

* Simplified Identity management
    A single, proven identity you can use for transactions **`across multiple industries and businesses`**. Enroll once and use anywhere Q5id is accepted.

* Security
    All data, stored and in transmission, is encrypted. In addition, Q5id converts biometric data into a **`template using a hashing algorithm`**. Even if a fraudster were able to get the template, it is impossible to reverse engineer the data.
